# Solution: Discussion: Unclassified reads

[← Back to Exercise](./discussion-3.md)

> **Unclassified reads** can be the result of different factors that can go from sequencing errors to problems with the algorithm being used
> to generate the result. The widely used Next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, 
> showed [average error rate of 0.24±0.06% per base](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29325-6).
> Besides the sequencing error, we need to consider the status of the database being used to perform the taxonomic assignation.  
> All the characterized genomes obtained by different research groups are scattered in different repositories, pages, and banks 
> in the cloud. Some are still unpublished. Incomplete databases can affect the performance of the taxonomic assignation. Imagine that 
> the dominant OTU in your sample belongs to a lineage that has never been characterized and does not have a public genome available to 
> be used as a template for the database. This possibility makes the assignation an impossible task and can promote the generation of false positives
> because the algorithm will assign a different identity to all those reads.
