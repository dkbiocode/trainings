# Exercise 3: Add metadata to beta diversity visualization

[← Back to Lesson](../../08-Diversity-tackled-with-R.md#exercise-3-add-metadata-to-beta-diversity-visualization)

> In the following figure, the beta diversity graph we produced earlier has been enriched. 
> Look at the code below and answer:    
> 1) Which instruction colored the samples by their corresponding treatment?  
> 2) What did the instruction `geom_text` do?   
> 3) What other difference do you notice with our previous graph?  
> 4) Do you see some clustering of the samples according to their treatment?
