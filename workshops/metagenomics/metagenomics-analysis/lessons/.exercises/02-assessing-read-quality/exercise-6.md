> If you lose your FastQC analysis results. How would you do it again but faster than the first time?
> As we have seen in a previous lesson, making scripts for repetitive tasks is a very efficient practice during bioinformatic pipelines.  
>
> > ## Solution
> > Make a new script with nano
> > ~~~
> > nano quality_control.sh
> > ~~~
> > 
> > 
> > Paste inside the commands that we used along with `echo` commands that shows you how the script is running. 
> > ~~~
> > set -e # This will ensure that our script will exit if an error occurs
> > cd ../../dc_workshop/data/untrimmed_fastq/
> > 
> > echo "Running FastQC ..."
> > fastqc *.fastq*
> > 
> > mkdir -p ../../dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads
> > 
> > echo "Saving FastQC results..."
> > mv *.zip ../../dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads/
> > mv *.html ../../dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads/
> > 
> > cd ../../dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads/
> > 
> > echo "Unzipping..."
> > for filename in *.zip
> >     do
> >     unzip $filename
> >     done
